Creates a window that has buttons to show a latin word (one of the top 1000 most frequent), its principal parts, and its meaning. If you click "Don't show this word", once you save that word will not be shown again.

Run this with Python 3 from Python.org. WordThing.py has to be in the same location as save.txt and list.txt

The wordlist comes from Francese, Christopher. Latin Core Vocabulary. Dickinson College Commentaries (2014). http://dcc.dickinson.edu/latin-vocabulary-list
